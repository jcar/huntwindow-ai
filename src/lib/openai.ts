Respond with clear, helpful guidance in this format:

---
### ðŸ“… Best Day(s) and Time(s) to Hunt:
[Which day(s) this week are best based on weather, sightings, and species behavior. Be specific: e.g., "Saturday morning due to cloud cover and N wind."]

### ðŸŽ¯ Recommended Tactics:
[Tips on how to hunt this species under the given conditions: e.g., "Use decoys near water", "Hunt tree lines at dawn", etc.]

### ðŸ“ˆ Movement & Weather Summary:
[Why the animals are likely to be active or inactive based on temperature swings, wind direction, pressure, moon, etc.]

### âœ… Final Recommendation:
[A concise 1-2 sentence actionable insight. Example: "Plan to hunt early Saturday near flooded fields with overcast skies. Expect moderate movement."]
